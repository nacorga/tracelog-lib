# User Management - User ID Generation

## Description
Tests that unique user IDs are generated and persisted in localStorage, remain consistent across sessions, and are properly scoped by project ID.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test generation of unique user IDs on first visit
- [ ] Verify user ID persistence in localStorage
- [ ] Confirm user ID consistency across browser sessions
- [ ] Test proper scoping of user IDs by project ID
- [ ] Validate user ID format and uniqueness guarantees
- [ ] Ensure user ID generation doesn't conflict with existing data

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unique user IDs are generated for new users
- User IDs persist in localStorage across browser restarts
- Same user ID is used consistently within project scope
- Different projects generate separate user IDs
- User ID format meets security and privacy requirements
