# User Management - User ID Persistence

## Description
Validates that user IDs survive browser restarts, localStorage clearing scenarios, and are recovered appropriately.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test user ID survival through browser restart cycles
- [ ] Verify behavior when localStorage is cleared
- [ ] Confirm user ID recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Test user ID regeneration when persistence fails
- [ ] Validate fallback behavior for storage unavailability
- [ ] Ensure user ID consistency during recovery scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- User IDs persist through normal browser restart cycles
- New user ID is generated when localStorage is cleared
- Recovery mechanisms handle partial data loss gracefully
- Fallback behavior maintains functionality without persistence
- User identification remains consistent within sessions

## Priority
High
