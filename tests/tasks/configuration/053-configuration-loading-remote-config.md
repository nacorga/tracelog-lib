# Configuration Loading - Remote Config

## Description
Validates that remote configuration is properly loaded from API, merged with local configuration, and applied to tracking behavior.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test remote configuration loading from API
- [ ] Verify merging of remote and local configuration
- [ ] Confirm configuration application to tracking behavior
- [ ] Test configuration caching and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Validate configuration precedence rules
- [ ] Ensure graceful handling of configuration load failures

## Acceptance Criteria
- Remote configuration is successfully loaded from API
- Local and remote configurations are merged appropriately
- Configuration changes affect tracking behavior as expected
- Configuration is cached and refreshed at appropriate intervals
- Configuration load failures don't break tracking functionality

## Priority
Medium
