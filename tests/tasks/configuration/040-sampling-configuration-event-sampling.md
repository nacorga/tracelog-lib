# Sampling Configuration - Event Sampling

## Description
Validates that sampling rates are properly applied to reduce event volume, users are consistently sampled, and QA mode bypasses sampling.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test sampling rate application to reduce event volume
- [ ] Verify consistent sampling for same user across sessions
- [ ] Confirm QA mode bypasses all sampling restrictions
- [ ] Test different sampling rates for different event types
- [ ] Validate sampling configuration changes take effect
- [ ] Ensure sampling doesn't affect critical events

## Acceptance Criteria
- Event sampling reduces volume according to configured rates
- Same users receive consistent sampling treatment
- QA mode allows all events through regardless of sampling
- Different event types respect individual sampling configurations
- Critical system events are never sampled out

## Priority
Medium
