# URL Exclusion - Session Events on Excluded Paths

## Description
Ensures that session start/end events are still tracked on excluded paths when necessary for session continuity.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test session start events on excluded paths
- [ ] Verify session end events are tracked on excluded paths
- [ ] Confirm session continuity across excluded and included paths
- [ ] Test session recovery on excluded paths
- [ ] Validate session timing accuracy with path exclusions
- [ ] Ensure session metadata includes path exclusion context

## Acceptance Criteria
- Session events are tracked on excluded paths for continuity
- Session timing remains accurate across path transitions
- Session recovery works regardless of excluded path status
- Session metadata indicates when events occur on excluded paths
- Overall session integrity is maintained with path exclusions

## Priority
Medium
