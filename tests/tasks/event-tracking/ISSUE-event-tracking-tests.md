- [ ] No false positives or missed events
- [ ] Proper error handling in QA mode

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Event capture latency < 50ms
- [ ] No impact on page scroll performance
- [ ] Click tracking doesn't delay user interactions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during testing

### Data Quality Requirements
- [ ] Coordinate calculations accurate within 5px
- [ ] Text extraction preserves meaningful content
- [ ] URL normalization removes sensitive data
- [ ] Metadata sanitization prevents XSS

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 14 test cases implemented and passing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Event data accuracy verified
- [ ] QA mode error handling tested
- [ ] Documentation updated with test coverage details
