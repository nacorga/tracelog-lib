# Custom Event Tracking - Metadata Sanitization

## Description
Verifies that potentially dangerous metadata (XSS patterns, script tags) is properly sanitized while preserving legitimate data.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test removal of XSS patterns from metadata values
- [ ] Verify script tags and executable code are sanitized
- [ ] Confirm legitimate data is preserved during sanitization
- [ ] Test sanitization of nested objects and arrays
- [ ] Validate HTML entity encoding where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure sanitization doesn't break valid JSON structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- XSS patterns and script tags are removed from metadata
- Legitimate data remains intact after sanitization process
- Nested structures are properly sanitized recursively
- Sanitized metadata maintains valid JSON structure
- No executable code can be injected through metadata

## Priority
High
