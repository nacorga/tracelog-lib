# Click Tracking - Coordinate Calculation

## Description
Ensures that both absolute and relative click coordinates are calculated correctly for elements of various sizes and positions.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test absolute coordinate calculation for various screen positions
- [ ] Verify relative coordinates within clicked elements
- [ ] Confirm coordinate accuracy for elements with transforms
- [ ] Test coordinate calculation for scrolled pages
- [ ] Validate coordinates for elements with different positioning
- [ ] Ensure coordinate precision and consistency

## Acceptance Criteria
- Absolute coordinates accurately reflect screen position of clicks
- Relative coordinates correctly represent position within elements
- Coordinates remain accurate regardless of page scroll position
- CSS transforms don't affect coordinate calculation accuracy
- Different positioning methods (absolute, fixed, etc.) work correctly
