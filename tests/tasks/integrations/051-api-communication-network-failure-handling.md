# API Communication - Network Failure Handling

## Description
Validates retry logic, exponential backoff, and event persistence when API requests fail due to network issues.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test retry logic for failed API requests
- [ ] Verify exponential backoff strategy implementation
- [ ] Confirm event persistence during network failures
- [ ] Test maximum retry limits and fallback behavior
- [ ] Validate network error detection and classification
- [ ] Ensure events are not lost during network issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- Failed requests trigger appropriate retry mechanisms
- Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming the API during issues
- Events are persisted and recovered when network restores
- Retry limits prevent infinite retry loops
- Network failures don't result in data loss

## Priority
High
