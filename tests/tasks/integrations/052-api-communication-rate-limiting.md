# API Communication - Rate Limiting

## Description
Tests that rate limiting is respected and events are properly queued when API rate limits are exceeded.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test rate limit detection and handling
- [ ] Verify event queuing when rate limits exceeded
- [ ] Confirm backoff behavior for rate-limited requests
- [ ] Test rate limit recovery and normal operation resumption
- [ ] Validate rate limit headers and response handling
- [ ] Ensure events are not lost due to rate limiting

## Acceptance Criteria
- Rate limits are detected from API responses
- Events are queued appropriately when rate limited
- System backs off and retries after rate limit periods
- Normal operation resumes after rate limits clear
- No events are lost due to rate limiting
