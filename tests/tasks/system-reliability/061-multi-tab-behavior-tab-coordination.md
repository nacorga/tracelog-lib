# Multi-Tab Behavior - Tab Coordination

## Description
Validates that multiple tabs coordinate properly through BroadcastChannel for session management and event tracking.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test BroadcastChannel communication between tabs
- [ ] Verify session state synchronization across tabs
- [ ] Confirm event coordination prevents duplication
- [ ] Test tab communication during session management
- [ ] Validate message passing reliability and timing
- [ ] Ensure fallback behavior when BroadcastChannel unavailable

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple tabs communicate effectively through BroadcastChannel
- Session state remains consistent across all tabs
- Event duplication is prevented through tab coordination
- Message passing works reliably for session management
- Graceful fallback when BroadcastChannel is not supported

## Priority
