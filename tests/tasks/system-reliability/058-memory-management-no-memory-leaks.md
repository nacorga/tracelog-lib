# Memory Management - No Memory Leaks

## Description
Tests that repeated initialization and destruction cycles don't cause memory leaks or accumulate event listeners.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test multiple init/destroy cycles for memory leaks
- [ ] Verify event listeners don't accumulate over cycles
- [ ] Confirm storage references are properly cleaned up
- [ ] Test DOM node references are released appropriately
- [ ] Validate timer and interval cleanup across cycles
- [ ] Ensure stable memory usage over extended testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- Memory usage remains stable across init/destroy cycles
- Event listeners are properly cleaned up in each cycle
- No DOM references persist after destroy operations
- Storage cleanup prevents data accumulation
- System performance remains consistent over time
