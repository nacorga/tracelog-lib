## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure and Style
**IMPORTANT**: All tests must follow the style and structure of `/tests/e2e/app.spec.ts`. Use this file as the reference for:

- Test organization using `test.describe()` blocks
- Async/await patterns with Playwright
- Page navigation and loading patterns (`page.goto('/')`, `page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')`)
- Console message monitoring with `page.on('console', ...)` 
- Element selection using `page.getByTestId()` and similar selectors
- Assertion patterns with `expect()` and `toContainText()`, `toHaveLength()`, etc.
- Timeout handling with `page.waitForTimeout()` when needed
- Test naming conventions and structure

**Example test structure following app.spec.ts style**:
```typescript
test.describe('Lorem Ipsum', () => {
  test('should ...', async ({ page }) => {
    // Follow app.spec.ts patterns for page navigation and assertions
    await page.goto('/');
    await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
    
    // Test implementation following established patterns
  });
});
```
