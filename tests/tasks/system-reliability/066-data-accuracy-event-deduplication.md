# Data Accuracy - Event Deduplication

## Description
Tests that duplicate events are properly identified and deduplicated while preserving legitimate repeated events.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test deduplication of identical events within time window
- [ ] Verify legitimate repeated events are preserved
- [ ] Confirm deduplication logic across different event types
- [ ] Test deduplication configuration and thresholds
- [ ] Validate deduplication doesn't affect event ordering
- [ ] Ensure deduplication works with page refreshes

## Acceptance Criteria
- Duplicate events within threshold time are deduplicated
- Legitimate repeated events are preserved and tracked
- Deduplication logic works consistently across event types
- Deduplication thresholds can be configured appropriately
- Event chronological ordering is maintained after deduplication

## Priority
Medium
