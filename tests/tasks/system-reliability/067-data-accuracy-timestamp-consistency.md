# Data Accuracy - Timestamp Consistency

## Description
Validates that event timestamps are accurate, consistent, and properly ordered in the event queue.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test timestamp accuracy against system clock
- [ ] Verify chronological ordering of events in queue
- [ ] Confirm timestamp consistency across browser tabs
- [ ] Test timestamp precision and resolution
- [ ] Validate timestamp handling during rapid events
- [ ] Ensure timestamps survive queue persistence and recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- Event timestamps accurately reflect when events occurred
- Events maintain chronological order in processing queue
- Timestamp precision is sufficient for accurate analysis
- Rapid events receive distinct timestamps
- Timestamps remain consistent across tabs and sessions
