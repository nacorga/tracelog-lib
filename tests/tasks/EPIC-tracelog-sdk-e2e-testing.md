- **Security Compliance**: Validated data sanitization and XSS prevention

## Epic Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Complete Functional Coverage**: Test all SDK features and edge cases
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Validate functionality across modern browsers
3. **Performance Validation**: Ensure minimal performance impact on host applications
4. **Security Validation**: Verify data sanitization and security measures
5. **Integration Testing**: Validate external service integrations

### Success Metrics
