# Performance Impact - Library Overhead

## Description
Validates that the library has minimal impact on page performance, doesn't block the main thread, and uses passive event listeners where appropriate.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test library initialization time and resource usage
- [ ] Verify main thread is not blocked by tracking operations
- [ ] Confirm passive event listeners are used where appropriate
- [ ] Test memory footprint and resource consumption
- [ ] Validate event processing doesn't impact page performance
- [ ] Ensure async operations don't interfere with user interactions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Library initialization completes quickly with minimal resource usage
- Main thread remains responsive during all tracking operations
- Passive event listeners prevent scroll and touch blocking
- Memory usage remains stable and proportional
- User interactions are not delayed by tracking functionality

## Priority
High
