## Overview

This issue covers the implementation of **4 E2E tests** for TraceLog SDK initialization functionality. These tests validate library initialization, configuration handling, error scenarios, and QA mode setup.

## Test Coverage

### Library Initialization (4 tests)
- [ ] **001**: Valid TraceLog.init() with project ID
- [ ] **002**: Invalid project ID handling and error messages
- [ ] **003**: Multiple initialization attempts and safety checks
- [ ] **004**: QA mode initialization and enhanced logging

## Initialization Flow Testing

### Initialization Performance Requirements
- Total initialization time: <500ms
- Configuration loading: <200ms
- Storage operations: <100ms
- Event handler registration: <100ms
- User ID generation: <50ms
- Session setup: <50ms

## Error Scenarios and Recovery

### Initialization Failure Scenarios
- Network failures during remote config loading
- localStorage access denied or unavailable
- Invalid configuration parameter formats
- Conflicting SDK instances or versions
- Resource loading failures (external dependencies)

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Graceful fallback to default configuration
- In-memory storage when localStorage unavailable
- Retry logic for network-dependent operations
- Clear error reporting for debugging
- Safe initialization state management

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All 4 initialization tests pass consistently across browsers
- [ ] Valid project IDs initialize SDK successfully
- [ ] Invalid project IDs handled with clear error messages
- [ ] Multiple initialization attempts managed safely
- [ ] QA mode provides enhanced debugging capabilities

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Initialization completes within 500ms
- [ ] No memory leaks during repeated initialization cycles
- [ ] Minimal performance impact on host application
- [ ] Efficient resource allocation and cleanup

### Reliability Requirements
- [ ] Initialization success rate >99.9% with valid configuration
- [ ] Error handling prevents SDK crashes or conflicts
- [ ] State consistency maintained across initialization attempts
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms work for all failure scenarios

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 4 test cases implemented and passing
- [ ] Valid initialization tested with comprehensive configuration options
- [ ] Invalid project ID handling verified with clear error messages
- [ ] Multiple initialization safety checks working correctly
- [ ] QA mode enhanced logging validated thoroughly
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Performance requirements met for all initialization scenarios
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure modes
- [ ] Documentation updated with initialization specifications
