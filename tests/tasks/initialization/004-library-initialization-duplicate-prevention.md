# Library Initialization - Duplicate Initialization Prevention

## Description
Ensures that calling TraceLog.init() multiple times doesn't create duplicate instances or interfere with existing tracking functionality.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test multiple consecutive init() calls
- [ ] Verify no duplicate event handlers are created
- [ ] Confirm existing tracking continues to work
- [ ] Test init() with different configurations
- [ ] Validate memory management during re-initialization
- [ ] Ensure consistent behavior across calls

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple init() calls don't break functionality
- No memory leaks from duplicate handlers
- Existing sessions and tracking remain intact
- Later init() calls either ignored or properly handled
- Configuration updates work correctly

## Priority
Medium
