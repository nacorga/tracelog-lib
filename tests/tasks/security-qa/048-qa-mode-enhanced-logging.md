# QA Mode - Enhanced Logging

## Description
Tests that QA mode enables detailed console logging, shows all events including those that would be sampled out, and provides debugging information.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test enhanced console logging activation in QA mode
- [ ] Verify all events are shown regardless of sampling
- [ ] Confirm detailed debugging information is provided
- [ ] Test logging includes event processing details
- [ ] Validate QA mode doesn't affect production performance
- [ ] Ensure logging helps with troubleshooting issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- QA mode activates comprehensive console logging
- All events are logged including those normally sampled out
- Debugging information helps identify configuration issues
- Event processing steps are visible in logs
- QA mode logging doesn't impact normal operation
