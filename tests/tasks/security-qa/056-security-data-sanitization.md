# Security - Data Sanitization

## Description
Tests that potentially sensitive data is sanitized according to security patterns and size limits are enforced.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test sensitive data pattern detection and removal
- [ ] Verify size limits are enforced for all data inputs
- [ ] Confirm sanitization of PII patterns (emails, phones, etc.)
- [ ] Test data truncation for oversized inputs
- [ ] Validate sanitization doesn't break data structure
- [ ] Ensure consistent sanitization across all event types

## Acceptance Criteria
- Sensitive data patterns are consistently detected and sanitized
- Size limits prevent excessive data from being processed
- PII is removed or masked appropriately
- Data structure integrity is maintained after sanitization
- Sanitization applies uniformly across all event types

## Priority
High
