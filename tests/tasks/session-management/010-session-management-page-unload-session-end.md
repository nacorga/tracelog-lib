# Session Management - Page Unload Session End

## Description
Verifies that sessions properly end on page unload/beforeunload events, uses synchronous methods for reliable event delivery, and tracks SESSION_END with 'page_unload' reason.

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Verify synchronous event delivery methods are used during unload
- [ ] Confirm SESSION_END event includes 'page_unload' reason
- [ ] Validate session cleanup occurs during page unload
- [ ] Test event delivery reliability during rapid navigation
- [ ] Ensure session state is properly saved before unload

## Acceptance Criteria
- SESSION_END event is consistently tracked on page unload
- Synchronous delivery ensures event reaches API before page closes
- Session cleanup prevents memory leaks and orphaned sessions
- Events include proper reason code for page unload scenario
- Session state persists through unload for potential recovery
