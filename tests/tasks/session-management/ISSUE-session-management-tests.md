# E2E Testing: Session Management Tests

## Overview

This issue covers the implementation of **6 E2E tests** for session management functionality in the TraceLog SDK. These tests validate session lifecycle, timeout handling, cross-tab coordination, and session recovery mechanisms.

## Session Performance Requirements

### Session Management Performance
- Session creation: <100ms
- Session recovery: <200ms
- Activity detection latency: <50ms per event
- Cross-tab synchronization: <100ms message propagation
- Session end processing: <200ms
- Storage operations: <50ms per operation

### Memory and Storage Efficiency
- Session data storage: <1KB per session
- Cross-tab message overhead: <100 bytes per message
- Activity detection memory usage: <500KB
- Session cleanup: Complete resource disposal

## Cross-Browser Session Compatibility

### BroadcastChannel Support
- Chrome/Edge: Full BroadcastChannel support
- Firefox: Full BroadcastChannel support
- Safari: BroadcastChannel support in 15.4+
- Fallback: localStorage-based cross-tab communication

### Storage Compatibility
- localStorage: Universal support across target browsers
- sessionStorage: Available for temporary session data
- Storage quota: Efficient usage with cleanup

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All 6 session management tests pass consistently
- [ ] Sessions created and managed correctly throughout lifecycle
- [ ] Timeout handling accurate with configurable values
- [ ] Session recovery works after browser restart
- [ ] Cross-tab coordination maintains session consistency
- [ ] Activity detection extends sessions appropriately
- [ ] Session end events generated with complete metadata

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Session operations meet performance benchmarks
- [ ] Cross-tab communication efficient and reliable
- [ ] Activity detection doesn't impact application performance
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended sessions

### Reliability Requirements
- [ ] Session continuity maintained across browser restarts
- [ ] Cross-tab coordination works reliably
- [ ] Session timeout accuracy within Â±30 seconds
- [ ] Session data integrity maintained throughout lifecycle

## Definition of Done
