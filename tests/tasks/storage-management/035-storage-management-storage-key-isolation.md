# Storage Management - Storage Key Isolation

## Description
Ensures that different project IDs use isolated storage keys and don't interfere with each other's data.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test storage key isolation between different project IDs
- [ ] Verify no data leakage between projects
- [ ] Confirm proper key prefixing and namespacing
- [ ] Test concurrent projects on same domain
- [ ] Validate cleanup doesn't affect other projects
- [ ] Ensure project-specific data remains isolated

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each project ID maintains completely isolated storage
- No data contamination occurs between different projects
- Storage keys use proper prefixes to prevent conflicts
- Multiple projects can coexist without interference
- Project cleanup affects only relevant data

## Priority
Medium
