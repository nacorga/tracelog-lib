# Storage Management - LocalStorage Operations

## Description
Validates that all storage operations (get, set, remove) work correctly and gracefully fallback to in-memory storage when localStorage is unavailable.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test localStorage get, set, and remove operations
- [ ] Verify fallback to in-memory storage when localStorage unavailable
- [ ] Confirm data integrity during storage operations
- [ ] Test storage quota handling and limits
- [ ] Validate error handling for storage failures
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of storage keys on removal

## Acceptance Criteria
- All storage operations work correctly when localStorage available
- Graceful fallback to in-memory storage maintains functionality
- Data integrity is preserved across storage operations
- Storage quota limits are handled appropriately
- Error conditions don't crash the application
