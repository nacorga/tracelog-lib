# Event Queue Management - Immediate Flush

## Description
Tests that events can be immediately flushed using both async and sync methods, particularly during page unload scenarios.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test immediate flush using asynchronous methods
- [ ] Verify synchronous flush for page unload scenarios
- [ ] Confirm both flush methods clear the queue completely
- [ ] Test flush reliability under various timing conditions
- [ ] Validate flush behavior with network connectivity issues
- [ ] Ensure flush operations don't lose events

## Acceptance Criteria
- Immediate flush successfully sends all queued events
- Synchronous flush works reliably during page unload
- Queue is properly cleared after successful flush
- Network issues are handled appropriately during flush
- No events are lost during flush operations

## Priority
High
