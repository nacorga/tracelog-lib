# Event Queue Management - Queue Processing

## Description
Tests that events are properly queued, batched, and sent to the API endpoint at regular intervals with deduplication.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test event queuing and batching mechanisms
- [ ] Verify regular interval processing of event queue
- [ ] Confirm deduplication prevents duplicate events
- [ ] Test queue processing under various load conditions
- [ ] Validate proper event ordering within batches
- [ ] Ensure queue processing doesn't block main thread

## Acceptance Criteria
- Events are properly queued and batched for efficient delivery
- Queue processing occurs at configured intervals
- Duplicate events are identified and deduplicated
- Event ordering is preserved within queue processing
- Queue operations don't impact application performance

## Priority
High
