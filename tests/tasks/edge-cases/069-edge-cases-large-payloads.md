# Edge Cases - Large Payloads

## Description
Validates handling of events with large metadata objects, ensuring they are either accepted or gracefully rejected with clear errors.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test handling of events with large metadata objects
- [ ] Verify size limit enforcement and error messages
- [ ] Confirm graceful rejection of oversized payloads
- [ ] Test memory safety with extremely large objects
- [ ] Validate truncation behavior for large text content
- [ ] Ensure system stability with large payload attempts

## Acceptance Criteria
- Large metadata objects are handled according to size limits
- Clear error messages are provided when payloads exceed limits
- System remains stable when processing large objects
- Truncation preserves data integrity within size constraints
- Memory usage is controlled when handling large payloads

## Priority
Medium
