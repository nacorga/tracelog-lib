# Edge Cases - Rapid Navigation

## Description
Tests behavior during rapid page navigation, ensuring events are not lost and session continuity is maintained.

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Test rapid navigation using browser back/forward buttons
- [ ] Verify events are not lost during quick page changes
- [ ] Confirm session continuity through rapid navigation
- [ ] Test event queue persistence during navigation storms
- [ ] Validate proper cleanup and initialization cycles
- [ ] Ensure performance remains stable during rapid changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- No events are lost during rapid page navigation sequences
- Session continuity is maintained through quick navigation
- Event queues persist and recover properly during rapid changes
- System performance remains stable under navigation stress
- Proper cleanup occurs between rapid initialization cycles

## Priority
Medium
