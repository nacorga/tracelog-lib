# Security & Privacy Audit

Comprehensive security and privacy audit based on SECURITY.md guidelines.

## Reference Document

@SECURITY.md

## Automated Scans

### 1. PII Pattern Detection

Check for potential PII capture in click tracking:

!grep -rn "textContent\|innerText" src/handlers/ || echo "No textContent usage found"

!grep -rn "\.value" src/handlers/ || echo "No .value access found"

### 2. Sensitive Data Handling

Check sanitization implementations:

!grep -rn "sanitize" src/utils/security/ || echo "No sanitization utils found"

### 3. Query Parameter Filtering

Check for sensitive parameter defaults:

!grep -rn "sensitiveQueryParams\|DEFAULT_SENSITIVE" src/ || echo "Check sensitive params config"

### 4. Consent Management

Check for consent handling:

!grep -rn "consent\|setConsent\|doNotTrack" src/ || echo "No consent management found"

### 5. Storage Security

Check what's stored in localStorage:

!grep -rn "localStorage.setItem\|sessionStorage.setItem" src/managers/ || echo "Check storage usage"

### 6. Integration Loading

Check external script loading (GA, etc.):

!grep -rn "script\|createElement.*script" src/integrations/ || echo "Check integration loading"

## Manual Review Items

Review these files manually:

@src/handlers/click.handler.ts
@src/utils/security/sanitize.utils.ts
@src/constants/config.constants.ts
@src/integrations/google-analytics.integration.ts

=== GDPR COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST ===

- [ ] Consent required before tracking
- [ ] Users can opt-out
- [ ] No PII captured unintentionally

```

## Focus Areas

Based on SECURITY.md priorities:

### Phase 1 (Critical)
1. **Consent Management** (#1) - Legal compliance
2. **Click Tracking** (#2) - PII protection
3. **URL Parameters** (#3) - Token/email filtering
4. **GA Loading** (#5) - Consent-based loading

### Phase 2 (High)
5. **PII Sanitization** (#6) - Enhanced patterns
6. **Input Protection** (#9) - Prevent value capture
7. **Documentation** (#11) - Security transparency

### Phase 3 (Future)
8. **Storage Encryption** (#4)
9. **Data Retention** (#10)
10. **Anonymization** (#12)

## Output Summary

End with actionable summary:
